  <h1>Grid-Cell Neighborhoods Visualization</h1>

  <p>This visualization demonstrates solutions to the Grid-Cell Neighborhoods problem, which counts cells within Manhattan distance N of any positive value in a 2D grid.
    Current grid size: <span id="gridSize"></span>
  </p>

  <div class="example-container">
      <h2>Example 1: One positive cell fully contained; N=3</h2>
      <div id="grid1" class="grid"></div>
      <div class="results">Total cells in neighborhood: <span id="count1">0</span> (Expected: 25)</div>
      <div class="explanation">In this example, there is only one positive value, located near the center of a grid large enough to contain the N=3 neighborhood comfortably.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="example-container">
      <h2>Example 2: One positive cell near an edge; N=3</h2>
      <div id="grid2" class="grid"></div>
      <div class="results">Total cells in neighborhood: <span id="count2">0</span> (Expected: 21)</div>
      <div class="explanation">This is similar to Example 1, except that the positive cell is less than 3 steps from the left-hand side of the array. Four of the cells from Example 1 have "fallen off" the left-hand edge of the array.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="example-container">
      <h2>Example 3: Two positive values with disjoint neighborhoods; N=2</h2>
      <div id="grid3" class="grid"></div>
      <div class="results">Total cells in neighborhood: <span id="count3">0</span> (Expected: 26)</div>
      <div class="explanation">Each of the positive values has a 13-cell neighborhood, so the total number of cells within N=2 steps of a positive value is 26.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="example-container">
      <h2>Example 4: Two positive values with overlapping neighborhoods; N=2</h2>
      <div id="grid4" class="grid"></div>
      <div class="results">Total cells in neighborhood: <span id="count4">0</span> (Expected: 21)</div>
      <div class="explanation">The cells that are members of more than one neighborhood are only counted once. There are 5 cells that are members of both neighborhoods independently.</div>
      <div id="overlapping"></div>
  </div>

      <h2>Additional Test Cases</h2>
      <button id="showAdditional">Show Additional Test Cases</button>
      <div id="additionalTests" style="display: none;">
          <h3>N=0 - Only the positive cell itself</h3>
          <div id="gridN0" class="grid"></div>
          <div class="results">Total cells: <span id="countN0">0</span> (Expected: 1)</div>

          <h3>Corner value, N=2</h3>
          <div id="gridCorner" class="grid"></div>
          <div class="results">Total cells: <span id="countCorner">0</span> (Expected: 6)</div>

          <h3>Adjacent positives, N=1</h3>
          <div id="gridAdjacent" class="grid"></div>
          <div class="results">Total cells: <span id="countAdjacent">0</span> (Expected: 8)</div>
      </div>
